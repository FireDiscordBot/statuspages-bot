# What is this?

This is the source code for the bot used in the Status Discord server. It is very old and has not been updated in a long time, nor do I have any intention to continue the project.

# Is the server still open?

Invites have now been paused and the server will be deleted on November 24th, 2024

# Can I use this code?

Feel free, but I wouldn't recommend as it is very messy & buggy and I do not intend to provide any support for running it. The bot only supports statuspage.io pages via either webhooks or polling the API
